I'm having a party, and made a list of people I want to invite.  Unfortunately, I'm a terrible friend and made a couple of spelling errors.  Help me correct them!

Change "Hanna" to "Hannah" (there should be an 'h' at the end)

Change "Geoffrey" to "Jeffrey"

Change "aparna" to "Aparna" (capitalize it)
