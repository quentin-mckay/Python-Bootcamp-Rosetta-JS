It's time to create your own lists.  Define 2 separate lists: 

First, define a list called my_stuff .  It must be be at least 4 elements long.  The data is completely up to you, but it must contain at least 1 string and 1 float.
 
Next, define a list called nums . It should be a list containing all the numbers between 1 and 99 (including 99).  Don't type this out manually! Use what we learned at the end of the previous video!
