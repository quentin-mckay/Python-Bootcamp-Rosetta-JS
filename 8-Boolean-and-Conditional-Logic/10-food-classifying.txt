I've written some code at the top of the file for you. Please don't touch it, if you'd like the tests to work :)   All the code does is randomly set the food  variable to either 'apple','grape', 'bacon', 'steak', 'worm', or 'dirt'.   Don't worry about how it works for now, we'll learn more shortly.

When you run the prewritten code, food will be randomly assigned.  You task is to write code that will classify what food is.  

If food is set to either 'apple' or 'grape', your code should print 'fruit'.
If food is set to either 'bacon' or 'steak', your code should print 'meat'
If food is set to either 'dirt' or 'worm' your code should print 'yuck'
