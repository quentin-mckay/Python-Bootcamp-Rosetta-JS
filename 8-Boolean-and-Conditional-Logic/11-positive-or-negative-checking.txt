In this exercise x  and y  are two random variables.  The code at the top of the file randomly assigns them (we'll learn how it works later on).  For now, just leave it alone :)

If both are positive numbers, print "both positive". 
If both are negative, print "both negative". 
Otherwise, tell us which one is positive and which one is negative, e.g. "x is positive and y is negative"
The print statements are filled in for you, just add logic.
