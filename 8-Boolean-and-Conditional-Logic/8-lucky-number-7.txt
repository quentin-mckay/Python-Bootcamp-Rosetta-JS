At the top of the file is some starter code that randomly picks a number between 1 and 10, and saves it to a variable called choice.  Don't touch those lines! (please)

Your job is to write a simple conditional to check if choice  is 7.  If choice  is 7, print out "lucky".  Otherwise, print out "unlucky".
