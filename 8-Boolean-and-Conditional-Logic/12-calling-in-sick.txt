In this exercise you will be given a few variables that will be set randomly to Boolean values (True  or False ):

actually_sick  - when you legit have the flu!
kinda_sick  - you're feeling under the weather and it's enough to treat yoself with a day off if you can spare it
hate_your_job  - work sucks, I know... 
You're also given a random number of sick_days between 0 and 10.

Finally, there is a variable called calling_in_sick  that you must set to True  or False  based on the following scenarios:

Set to True if: 

you're actually_sick  and you have sick_days  remaining
you're kinda_sick  and hate_your_job  and you have sick_days  remaining
Otherwise, set to False.
