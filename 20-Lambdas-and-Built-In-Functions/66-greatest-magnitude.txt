Write a function max_magnitude  that accepts a single list full of numbers. It should return the magnitude of the number with the largest magnitude (the number that is furthest away from zero).

max_magnitude([300, 20, -900])   #900

max_magnitude([10, 11, 12])   #12

max_magnitude([-5, -1, -89])   #89
