This exercise is a little harder than the previous make_noise  function. 

Write a function called generate_evens  that returns a list of the even numbers between 1 and 50(not including 50). 
Basically, it should return a list: [2,4,6....all the way up to 48] 
Inside the function, you can construct the list using either a loop OR list comprehension.
You do not need to call the function in this exercise, defining it is enough.
