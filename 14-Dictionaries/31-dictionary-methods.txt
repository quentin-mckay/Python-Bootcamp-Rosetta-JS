I've provided you with a start dictionary called inventory. 

inventory = {'croissant': 19, 'bagel': 4, 'muffin': 8, 'cake': 1} #DON'T CHANGE THIS LINE! 

Follow the instructions found in the comments:

1. Make a copy of inventory  and save it to a variable called stock_list  using a dictionary method we've covered

2. Add the value 18 to stock_list  under the key "cookie"

3. Remove 'cake' from stock_list  using a dictionary method we've learned
