Imagine we're creating a video game and want to model the initial starting-state of our game.  I've provided you with a list of strings called game_properties.

Use dict.fromkeys  to generate a new dictionary using the provided game_properties  list.  Initialize all values to 0 .  

Save the result in a variable called initial_game_state 

HINT: the end result should look like this:

{'current_score': 0, 'high_score': 0, 'number_of_lives': 0, 'items_in_inventory': 0, 'power_ups': 0, 'ammo': 0, 'enemies_on_screen': 0, 'enemy_kills': 0, 'enemy_kill_streaks': 0, 'minutes_played': 0, 'notifications': 0, 'achievements': 0}
