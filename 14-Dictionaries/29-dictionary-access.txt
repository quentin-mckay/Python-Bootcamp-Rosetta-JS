For this exercise, I've defined some code for you already.

The food  variable will store a randomly chosen food string like "gummy bear" or "morning bun".  Some of these items are in the bakery_stock  dictionary, and some are not.

Your task is to simply print out a string depending on if food  is a value in bakery_stock .If food  is contained in bakery_stock  print out a string that states how many items are left: "3 left" if food is "toffee cookie" or "1 left" if food is "morning bun", etc.

If food is not contained in bakery_stock  (like "gummy bear"), print out "We don't make that"
