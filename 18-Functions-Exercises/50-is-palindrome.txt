Write a function called is_palindrome. A Palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. This function should take in one parameter and returns True or False depending on whether it is a palindrome. As a bonus, allow your function to ignore whitespace and capitalization so that is_palindrome('a man a plan a canal Panama') returns True.
