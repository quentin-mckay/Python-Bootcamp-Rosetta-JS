Write a function called return_day. this function takes in one parameter (a number from 1-7) and returns the day of the week (1 is Sunday, 2 is Monday, 3 is Tuesday etc.). If the number is less than 1 or greater than 7, the function should return None

Hint: store the days of the week in a list (or dict using numbers as keys).
