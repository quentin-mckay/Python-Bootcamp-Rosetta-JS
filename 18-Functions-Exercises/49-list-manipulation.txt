Write a function called list_manipulation. This function should take in four parameters (a list, command, location and value).

If the command is "remove" and the location is "end", the function should remove the last value in the list and return the value removed
If the command is "remove" and the location is "beginning", the function should remove the first value in the list and return the value removed
If the command is "add" and the location is "beginning", the function should add the value (fourth parameter) to the beginning of the list and return the list
If the command is "add" and the location is "end", the function should add the value (fourth parameter) to the end of the list and return the list
