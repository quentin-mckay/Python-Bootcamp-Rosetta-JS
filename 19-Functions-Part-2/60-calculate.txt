Oh boy, this is a complicated set of instructions.  Bear with me. Write a function called calculate that accepts a list of keyword arguments

make_float , a boolean which returns a float if True or an integer if False.

operation which is either 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', and 'divide'. 

first which is a number, second , which is another number, and message which is a string that can be added.

The function should return the result of actually running the specified operation with the first and second keyword arguments. The result of the operation with the first  and second  is an integer if the make_float  keyword argument is False , otherwise the result of the operation is a float. If a message is specified, it should return the message keyword argument + the result of the operation.  Otherwise, it should return the string  "The result is " joined with the result of the operation.
