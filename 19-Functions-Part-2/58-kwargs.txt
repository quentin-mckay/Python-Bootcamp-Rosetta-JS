Note: for this exercise, make use of **kwargs.  No default parameters allowed!

Write a function called combine_words  which accepts a single string called word and any number of additional key word arguments.  If a prefix is provided, return the prefix followed by the word.  If a suffix is provided, return the word followed by the suffix.  If neither is provided, just return the word.  It might sound confusing, but the examples should make this a lot clearer!

combine_words("child")  #'child'

combine_words("child", prefix="man")  #'manchild'

combine_words("child", suffix="ish")  #'childish'
