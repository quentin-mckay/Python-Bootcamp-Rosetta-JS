Given a person variable:

person = [["name", "Jared"], ["job", "Musician"], ["city", "Bern"]] 

Create a dictionary called answer , that makes each first item in each list a key and the second item a corresponding value.  That's a terrible explanation.  I think it'll be easier if you just look at the end goal:

{'name': 'Jared', 'job': 'Musician', 'city': 'Bern'}
