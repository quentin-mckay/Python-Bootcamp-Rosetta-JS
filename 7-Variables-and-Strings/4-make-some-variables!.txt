Now that we've learned about variables and data types, let's get some practice.  Or, skip this! Totally up to you!

Define a variable named city  and set it equal to any string
Define a variable named price  and set it equal to any float
Define a variable named high_score  and set it equal to any int
Define a variable named is_having_fun  and set it to a boolean value
You do not need to print them out, but can if you want.
