For this exercise, you'll be working with a file called users.csv . Each row of data consists of two columns: a user's first name, and a user's last name.

Implement the following function:

find_user : Takes in a first name and a last name and searches for a user with that first and last name in the users.csv file. If the user is found, find_user  returns the index where the user is found. Otherwise it returns a message stating that the user wasn't found.
